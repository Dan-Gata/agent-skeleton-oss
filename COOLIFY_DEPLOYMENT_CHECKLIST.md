# Coolify Deployment - Pre-Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Dockerfile Issues
- [x] **BOM Character Removed**: UTF-8 BOM (EF BB BF) removed from Dockerfile start
- [x] **Layer Caching Optimized**: Package files copied before source code
- [x] **CACHEBUST Updated**: Changed to v4_20251025 to force rebuild
- [x] **Comments Added**: Documented each build step

### 2. Dependencies Issues
- [x] **Root package.json Complete**: Added all 14 orchestrator dependencies
- [x] **Dependencies Alphabetized**: Easier to maintain
- [x] **Node Version Updated**: Changed from >=18.0.0 to >=20.0.0

### 3. Docker Ignore Issues
- [x] **.env Files Excluded**: All environment files added to .dockerignore
- [x] **Documentation Excluded**: Most .md files excluded (except DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md)
- [x] **Build Artifacts Excluded**: docker-compose, deploy scripts, etc.

## üìã Deployment Verification

### Before Pushing to Coolify
- [x] BOM removed from Dockerfile (verified with `od -A x -t x1z`)
- [x] All dependencies present in root package.json
- [x] package.json is valid JSON
- [x] .dockerignore properly configured
- [x] Start script points to correct path

### Files Changed
1. `Dockerfile` - Fixed BOM, optimized caching, updated CACHEBUST
2. `package.json` - Added 10 missing dependencies, updated Node version
3. `.dockerignore` - Added .env files and other exclusions
4. `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md` - Documented all issues and fixes (NEW)
5. `COOLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - This file (NEW)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps for Coolify

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
If auto-deploy is enabled in Coolify:
1. Push changes to main branch
2. Coolify will automatically detect the new commit
3. Build will start automatically
4. Monitor build logs in Coolify dashboard

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Go to Coolify dashboard: https://kaussan-air.org (or your Coolify URL)
2. Navigate to your application
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button
5. Monitor build logs

### Build Process Expected
```
Step 1: FROM node:20-alpine              ‚úÖ
Step 2: RUN echo "Build triggered..."     ‚úÖ
Step 3: WORKDIR /app                      ‚úÖ
Step 4: RUN apk add python3 make g++ wget ‚úÖ
Step 5: COPY package*.json files          ‚úÖ
Step 6: RUN npm install (root)            ‚úÖ Should work now!
Step 7: WORKDIR /app/packages/orchestrator ‚úÖ
Step 8: RUN npm install (orchestrator)    ‚úÖ Should work now!
Step 9: WORKDIR /app                      ‚úÖ
Step 10: COPY source code                 ‚úÖ
Step 11: EXPOSE 3000                      ‚úÖ
Step 12: Container starts                 ‚úÖ
Step 13: Health check passes              ‚úÖ
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Build Logs
Look for these success indicators:
```
‚úÖ npm install completed successfully
‚úÖ better-sqlite3 compiled without errors
‚úÖ No "UNMET DEPENDENCY" errors
‚úÖ No "missing: xxx" errors
‚úÖ Container started
‚úÖ Health check passing
```

### 2. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.1-force-rebuild",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T...",
  "uptime": 123,
  "services": {
    "database": "operational",
    "openrouter": "configured/not configured",
    ...
  }
}
```

### 3. Test Application
1. Navigate to: `https://your-domain.com/`
2. Should see login page or dashboard
3. Test core functionality:
   - Login/Authentication
   - Dashboard loads
   - Chat IA works (if API keys configured)
   - File upload works

## üêõ If Build Still Fails

### Check These Common Issues

#### Build Logs Show "npm ERR! missing: xxx"
- This should be fixed now, but if it still appears:
- Verify package.json on GitHub matches the fixed version
- Force clear Coolify build cache

#### Build Logs Show Docker Parse Error
- This should be fixed (BOM removed), but if it still appears:
- Verify Dockerfile on GitHub has no BOM
- Check file encoding is UTF-8 without BOM

#### Container Starts But Health Check Fails
- Check runtime logs in Coolify
- Verify PORT environment variable is set to 3000
- Verify application is actually listening on port 3000

#### better-sqlite3 Compilation Fails
- This should work with python3, make, g++ installed
- Check Alpine Linux package repository is accessible
- May need to retry build if Alpine mirrors are slow

### Debugging Commands

In Coolify shell/console (if available):
```bash
# Check Node version
node --version
# Should show: v20.x.x

# Check dependencies installed
ls -la node_modules/ | head -20

# Check package.json
cat package.json | grep -A 15 dependencies

# Test npm start
npm start
# Should start server without errors
```

## üìä Summary

### What Was Blocking Deployment
1. **UTF-8 BOM in Dockerfile** ‚Üí Docker couldn't parse it properly
2. **Missing dependencies** ‚Üí npm install failed during build
3. **Incomplete package.json** ‚Üí ejs was declared but not installed

### What's Fixed Now
1. ‚úÖ Dockerfile has no BOM
2. ‚úÖ All 14 dependencies in package.json
3. ‚úÖ .dockerignore prevents .env leakage
4. ‚úÖ Optimized Docker layer caching
5. ‚úÖ CACHEBUST updated to force new build

### Expected Outcome
üéØ **Coolify should now successfully build and deploy the application**

The build process will:
- Parse Dockerfile correctly ‚úÖ
- Install all dependencies ‚úÖ
- Compile native modules (better-sqlite3) ‚úÖ
- Start the application ‚úÖ
- Pass health checks ‚úÖ

## üìû Support

If deployment still fails after these fixes:
1. Check the build logs in Coolify
2. Review the error messages
3. Compare with expected build process above
4. Verify all environment variables are set
5. Check the new documentation in DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md
