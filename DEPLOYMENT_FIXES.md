# Coolify Deployment - Issues Fixed

## Date: 2025-10-25

## Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ BOM (Byte Order Mark) in Dockerfile
**Issue**: The Dockerfile started with a UTF-8 BOM character (EF BB BF), which can cause Docker parsing errors and build failures.

**Impact**: Coolify may fail to parse the Dockerfile correctly, leading to deployment failures.

**Fix Applied**: Removed the BOM character from the Dockerfile.

### 2. ❌ Missing Dependencies in Root package.json
**Issue**: The root `package.json` only declared 4 dependencies (express, axios, dotenv, ejs), but `ejs` was missing from node_modules. The orchestrator package requires 14+ dependencies.

**Impact**: 
- `npm install` at root level would fail
- Docker build would fail at the first `RUN npm install --omit=dev` step
- Missing critical dependencies like better-sqlite3, helmet, cors, etc.

**Fix Applied**: Updated root package.json to include all dependencies from packages/orchestrator/package.json:
- axios
- better-sqlite3
- cookie-parser
- cors
- dotenv
- ejs
- express
- express-rate-limit
- express-validator
- helmet
- mammoth
- multer
- nodemailer
- pdf-parse

### 3. ⚠️ Node Version Mismatch
**Issue**: Root package.json specified `node >= 18.0.0` while Dockerfile uses Node 20.

**Impact**: Potential version inconsistencies.

**Fix Applied**: Updated engines in package.json to `node >= 20.0.0`.

### 4. ✅ Dockerfile Optimization
**Issue**: Original Dockerfile copied all files before installing dependencies, which prevented Docker layer caching from working effectively.

**Impact**: Every build would reinstall all dependencies even if package.json didn't change.

**Fix Applied**: Restructured Dockerfile to:
1. Copy package*.json files first
2. Run npm install (cached if package.json unchanged)
3. Copy the rest of the application

## Changes Made

### File: Dockerfile
```diff
- ﻿FROM node:20-alpine (with BOM)
+ FROM node:20-alpine (no BOM)

- ARG CACHEBUST=d34cca8_force_full_rebuild_v3_20251022
+ ARG CACHEBUST=d34cca8_force_full_rebuild_v4_20251025

+ # Copy package files first for better Docker layer caching
+ COPY package*.json ./
+ COPY packages/orchestrator/package*.json ./packages/orchestrator/

- COPY . .
+ # Install root dependencies
  RUN npm install --omit=dev

+ # Install orchestrator dependencies
  WORKDIR /app/packages/orchestrator
  RUN npm install --omit=dev

+ # Copy the rest of the application
  WORKDIR /app
+ COPY . .
```

### File: package.json

## Why Coolify Was Blocking Deployment

Coolify was blocking deployment because:

1. **Docker Build Failure**: The BOM in Dockerfile could cause parsing errors
2. **npm install Failure**: Missing dependencies would cause `npm install` to fail during Docker build
3. **Incomplete Dependencies**: The application couldn't run without all required packages (better-sqlite3, helmet, cors, etc.)

## Expected Build Process Now

With these fixes, the Docker build should:

1. ✅ Parse Dockerfile correctly (no BOM)
2. ✅ Install all dependencies at root level
3. ✅ Install orchestrator dependencies
4. ✅ Copy application files
5. ✅ Start the application successfully
6. ✅ Pass health checks

## Next Steps for Coolify Deployment

1. **Push these changes** to the main branch
2. **Trigger a new deployment** in Coolify:
   - Go to your application in Coolify
   - Click "Redeploy" or "Deploy"
   - Monitor build logs for success
3. **Verify** the deployment:
   - Check `/health` endpoint returns healthy status
   - Test the application functionality

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify Dockerfile has no BOM
head -c 10 Dockerfile | od -A x -t x1z -v
# Should show: 46 52 4f 4d (FROM), NOT ef bb bf 46

# Verify package.json is valid
node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').name)"
# Should output: agent-skeleton-oss

# Test npm install works
npm install --omit=dev
# Should complete without errors

# Test Docker build (locally)
docker build -t test-build .
# Should complete successfully
```

## Summary

**Root Cause**: The deployment was blocked by:
- UTF-8 BOM in Dockerfile (parsing issue)
- Missing dependencies in root package.json (build failure)

**Resolution**: 
- Removed BOM from Dockerfile ✅
- Added all required dependencies to root package.json ✅
- Optimized Dockerfile for better caching ✅
- Updated Node version requirement to 20+ ✅

**Status**: Ready for Coolify deployment 🚀
